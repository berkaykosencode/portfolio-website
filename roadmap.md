---

## Phase 2: Digital Atelier Portfolio (Week 2)

### Brand Positioning

**You are NOT a corporate agency. You are a personal luxury brand.**

### One-Page Portfolio Strategy

#### 1. Hero Section
```
"I build digital clinics for Turkey's top surgeons."
```
- **Specific > Generic**
- Include high-quality photo of yourself
- Doctors trust freelancers who show their face

#### 2. Killer Feature Demo
- Embed "Before/After" photo slider component
- Caption: *"Your patients want to see results. My code makes them look flawless."*
- Make it interactive and impressive

#### 3. The "No-Headache" Guarantee Section
List what you handle:
- ✅ Domain & Hosting Setup
- ✅ KVKK Compliant Forms (Crucial for Turkey)
- ✅ Mobile-First Design (Instagram Browser Compatible)
- ✅ WhatsApp Integration
- ✅ Before/After Gallery Systems
- ✅ 24/7 Technical Support

#### 4. Trust Indicators

- Your credentials/experience
- Simple contact form
- WhatsApp button (primary CTA)

---

## Phase 3: Sniper Acquisition Strategy (Week 3-4)

### Quality Over Quantity
**5 highly targeted DMs per week > 100 generic emails**

### Step 1: The "Broken Link" Hunt

**Where to Search:**
- Google Maps: *"Plastik Cerrah [Neighborhood]"*
- Target areas: Nişantaşı, Kadıköy, Konya Meram, etc.

**Red Flags to Look For:**
1. ❌ gmail.com address instead of domain email
2. ❌ Website link that doesn't open
3. ❌ Website looks terrible on mobile
4. ❌ No website at all (only Instagram)
5. ❌ Outdated design or broken features

**Week 3 Goal:** Scout 10 "bad website" doctors

### Step 2: The "Video Audit" DM (Golden Ticket)

**Why Video?**
- Doctors don't read long emails
- Video shows you actually care
- Demonstrates your expertise instantly

**Process:**
1. Record screen scrolling through their current site/Instagram
2. Create quick mockup (optional but powerful)
3. Send via **Instagram DM**

**Script Template:**
```
Hi [Doctor's Name],

I'm Berkay, a web developer based in Konya. 

I was looking at your Instagram—your work is amazing—but I noticed 
[specific issue: broken link/mobile problems/outdated design].

You're losing patients because of this.

I made a quick video showing how your before/after photos should 
look on a modern website. Check it out: [video link]

Would you be open to a quick chat?

Best,
Berkay
```

**Week 4 Goal:** Send 10 Video DMs
